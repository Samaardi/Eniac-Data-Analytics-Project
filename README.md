# Eniac E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to my second data project with Eniac, the e-commerce tech company. As a Data Analyst, I will be working with internal, non-anonymized data, which presents a more complex and chaotic dataset. This project will require the use of Python over SQL due to the complexity of the tasks.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to resolve an ongoing debate within the company: the effectiveness and impact of offering product discounts. The Marketing Team believes discounts are beneficial for customer acquisition, satisfaction, and retention, while the Board is concerned about the negative impact on total revenue and prefers to focus on quality over price competition.

## Key Business Questions

1. How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
2. What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
3. How many products are being discounted?
4. How significant are the offered discounts as a percentage of product prices?
5. How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
6. How could data collection be improved?

## Challenges

Before addressing the business questions, I need to tackle data inconsistencies and corruption within the dataset. The Database Administrator and the Software Engineer have differing opinions on the cause of the issues, but the company board needs timely insights regardless.

## Approach

1. **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluate the quality of the dataset to identify and understand inconsistencies.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Perform extensive data cleaning tasks to make the data usable and reliable.
3. **Data Analysis**: Use cleaned data to answer the key business questions and provide actionable insights.
4. **Presentation**: Prepare a concise, engaging, and convincing presentation for the company board to showcase the results of my analysis.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau

## Expected Outcome

The outcome of this project will be a detailed analysis of the impact of product discounts on customer behavior and company revenue. The insights will help the company make informed decisions about their discount strategy.
